1.
 Python arrays & list items can be accessed with positive or negative numbers (also known as index).
 - For instance  any array/list is of size n, then for positive index 0 is the first index, 1 second,
 last index will be n-1.
2.
list(range(0, 1001)) function call. As stop argument, we use the number 1001 because it's excluded from the final series.
3.
First, we will create a list of values to use in our slicing.
 # Create two lists to slice, the first is a numeric list from 1 to 9 (List A).
4.
 Indexing is used to obtain individual elements. Slicing: Slicing is used to obtain a sequence of elements.
5.
 when we slice a sequence outside of bounds, we can still return an empty sequence.
6.
1.Use a List and Pass It as an Argument to the Function. 
Any argument passed on to the function is considered to be of the same data type inside the walls of the function.
2.Use the tuple() Function in Python
3.Use the * Operator in Python.
7.
whenever the number of sources is not equal to the number of destinations, 
the assignment problem is called an unbalanced assignment problem.
8.
List comprehensions are often not only more readable but also faster than using “for loops.”
 They can simplify  the code, but if we put too much logic inside, they will instead become harder to read and understand.
